# Calculate API onboarding time in MuleSoft Anypoint Platform.

### User story 
As a project manager, I want to know the time between when an API specification is loaded into Anypoint Exchange and when the MuleSoft API specification implementation goes into production in API Manager, so that I can calculate the time it takes to onboard an API.  I also want to know the maximum and average times.

- Since this is an API specification the definition of production is when the API is published in the API Manager production environment (PROD)
- For large numbers of APIs, this report will need to use page sizes to limit the number of APIs returned on each call and multiple calls for each page is required.
